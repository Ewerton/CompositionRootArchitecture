# CompositionRoot Architecture
A simple solution to demonstrate how to implement a the "Composition Root" pattern in a .net solution.

The Composition Root assembly is te responsible to register all of your dependencies

I explored this concept in <a href="http://ewer.com.br/composition-root-and-di-containers/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.

I Also provided three "Views", a <a href="https://github.com/Ewerton/CompositionRootArchitecture/tree/master/ConsoleView" target="_blank">console view</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/Ewerton/CompositionRootArchitecture/tree/master/AspNetCoreMvcWebView" target="_blank">Asp.Net Core Mvc View</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/Ewerton/CompositionRootArchitecture/tree/master/AspNetMvcWebView" target="_blank">Asp.Net Mvc "Full Framework" View</a>
to show how to use this concept in different projects types.
